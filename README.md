# ISF Watchkeeper Report Reader
The script `extract_watchkeeper.py` reads reports from ISF Watchkeeper software that are in `sample.pdf` format, calculates some statistical values such as mean by positions and monthly periods, and prepares Excel reports with these values. The reports are assumed to be of the same ship. Each function in the script is thoroughly commented with all the input and outputs.

# Instructions
Clone the repository and install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, run the main script `extract_watchkeeper.py`, and use the function of your choice.
